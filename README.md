## Notes

This app did not reach complete development. After a session of programming, the app stopped showing up on the screen and I spent most of the day trying to figure out what happened and I had a lot of issues with Github and it ignoring my
entire app for some reason. I think my code should be okay or almost okay, but it is hard to tell when after a certain point the application no longer can be tested by running it. There are no launch errors as of right now so that is 
the bright side I guess.
